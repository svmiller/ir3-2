#' document. Instead, the student should invest energy into presenting 
#' important console output into a narrative format. In the context of the 
#' regression model, this is the regression table. `{modelsummary}` is going
#' to be doing some heavy-lifting here with respect to a silly sample analysis
#' I did around which students can pattern their final papers."

WVS <- readRDS("~/Koofr/teaching/eh1903-ir3/2/data/wvs-swe-6/wv6-sweden-v20201117.rds")
#' ^ Note: you have access to this, but I won't know where you put it on your
#' hard drive. You need to download it and load it.
#' 
#' Let's grab the information I used in the example paper I wrote for you.
#' Here's where I have to emphasize you need to read the codebook. The codebook
#' describes the variables included and tells you the basic information they 
#' are communicating. You have to read the codebook, whatever the codebook is.

WVS %>%
  select(
    #importance of democracy, justifiability of divorce
    V140, V205, 
    # age, sex, scale of incomes,
    V242, V240, V239, 
    # how often you pray, age completed education
    V146, V249) -> Data


#' ^ read the codebook. It'll tell you what you want.
#' 
#' Optional, but renames columns to be more informative. In most cases,
#' you should seriously think about doing this because a lot of variable names
#' in standing data sets are either vague or obscene to look at.
colnames(Data) <- c("impdem", "justdiv", "age", "sex", "inc", "pray", "educ")

#' Surveys typically make men to be 1 and women to be 2, but I've always hated
#'  this practice. This makes women to be 1 and men to be 0.
Data %>% mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 2, 1, 0)) -> Data

Data

#' Let's run the linear models I described in the paper.

# First model
M1 <- lm(impdem ~ justdiv, Data)
# Full model
M2 <- lm(impdem ~ justdiv + age + sex + inc + pray + educ, Data)

summary(M1)
summary(M2)

#' ## Prepare a table of descriptive statistics of your data. 
#'
#' Papers make routine use of the table of descriptive statistics to communicate
#' some basic features about the data. this is easily done in `{modelsummary}` 
#' with the `datasummary_skim()` function. The `datasummary()` function in the 
#' same package has more flexibility but this is easier to explain and its 
#' default format actually looks nicer.

Data %>% 
  # setNames(c("Imp. Dem.", "Justif. Divorce",
  #                      "Age", "Female", "Income", "Prayer Frequency",
  #                      "Age at End of Schooling")) %>%
  # na.omit %>%
  datasummary_skim(title = "Summary Statistics of the Data Used in this Analysis",
                   align = c("lcccccccc"),
                   histogram = TRUE,
                  # output = "tinytable",
                   notes = "You can put a footnote here.") 

#' Be mindful that the data I supplied here are *all* numeric and the data
#' has *only* what I want to summarize. This will try to (want to) summarize
#' everything, so be mindful what you are asking it to do.
#'
#' The `histogram = TRUE` is nice but often doesn't print well to documents (and
#' it won't in Word as I'm going to show you to do it). So, you can use this
#' (as a beginner) to get an idea of what your data look like and what issues
#' you may have, but you should disable it for use.
#'
#' Now, we're going to do a few things. First, we're going to "uncomment"
#' that `setNames()` comment, which is going to quickly rename our variables
#' to be something that would be insane for an analysis but easy for formatting
#' a table. It is apparently now a feature of `{modelsummary}` that it can scrape
#' variable labels if they're present in the data (as they often are for data
#' in the Stata format). However, you should not rely on this being the case (and
#' it isn't for the one variable we had to create ourselves). Next, we're going 
#' to disable that (`histogram = FALSE`) and knock off a "c" from the align 
#' argument.


Data %>% 
  setNames(c("Imp. Dem.", "Justif. Divorce",
                       "Age", "Female", "Income", "Prayer Frequency",
                       "Age at End of Schooling")) %>%
  # na.omit %>%
  datasummary_skim(title = "Summary Statistics of the Data Used in this Analysis",
                   align = c("lccccccc"),
                   histogram = F,
                   notes = "You can put a footnote here.") 

#' Looks nice, right? Let's copy-paste it into a Word document. Some cosmetic
#' things you'll have to do yourself (e.g. potential centering and what-not). All
#' you need is Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V (Cmd equivalent for you Mac users).
#' 
#' ## Make a plot or two or three
#' 
#' For what it's worth, this descriptive statistics table is pointing you to
#' potential issues you can encounter in your data. In this particular example,
#' I see several things I'll want to consider. For one, I see an Ã¶verliggare 
#' there who said they finished schooling at 83 (which, fam...). I see that
#' there is huge problems of left-skew. Most Swedes maximally value democracy,
#' are maximally permissive about divorce, and don't pray at all (per the codebook).
#' I can already anticipate these are going to be issues I should at least
#' acknowledge because I can suspect they're going to point me to problems in my
#' linear model.
#' 
#' At the least, I can offer a visual display of these. A bar chart should 
#' suffice.

Data %>%
  select(impdem) %>%
  na.omit %>%

       x = "Values of the Importance of Democracy",
       y = "Count of Observations") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1000))

#' Issues in the dependent variable will typically be the ones you should think
#' about first and the most, but you can see these issues manifest elsewhere.

Data %>%
  select(justdiv) %>%
  na.omit %>%

#' Now that you've created a graph that summarizes important features about your
#' data, save it (in RStudio) to a PNG file. Then, in your Word document, grab it
#' and move it in. You can also---if it pleases and sparkles---zoom into the plot,
#' right-click, copy image, and paste it into your Word document. Choice is yours.
#' 
#' ## Create a regression table
#' 
#' To really impress me, you'll need to have a regression table that summarizes
#' the results, and that summary cannot (well, really, really should not) be a 
#' PrtScrn job. You should get comfortable with the `modelsummary()` function in
#' R.
#' 
#' Its basic form looks something like this.

modelsummary(list(M1, M2))


#' Notice here that `modelsummary()` works best with list types, and lists are
#' just super-flexible ways of corralling a diverse set of object types in R.
#' Here, we have two regression summaries (`M1`, `M2`). We're wrapping them in a 
#' `list()`. `modelsummary()` will do what it does with them.
#'
#' There's a lot we should really think about doing here. First, it may be useful
#' to so-called "name" your regressions. In my sample paper, `M1` is a simple 
#' bivariate linear model and `M2` adds the control variables. I can name them
#' within `list()` like this.

modelsummary(list("Bivariate Regression" = M1,
                  "Full Model" = M2))

#' Next---and really important---thing I want to do is add asterisks to help
#' me identify so-called statistical significance. There are some customization
#' options here, but just add `stars = TRUE` here.

modelsummary(list("Bivariate Regression" = M1,
                  "Full Model" = M2),
             stars  = TRUE)

#' Next, and also really important, thing I want to do is rename the variables
#' to be something intuitive. This is the `coef_map` argument in `modelsummary()`.
#' Of note: it will help you to build the simple version above so you know what
#' you're looking at. In `coef_map`, there's a `c()` function that takes arguments
#' effectively communicating that "what the thing is called in the model, on the 
#' left, is going to be called this new thing, on the right". `justdiv` is my main
#' independent variable, but "Justifiability of Divorce" is what I want to call 
#' it.

modelsummary(list("Bivariate Regression" = M1,
                  "Full Model" = M2),
             stars  = TRUE,
             coef_map = c("justdiv" = "Justifiability of Divorce",
                          "age" = "Age",
                          "educ" = "Age at End of Schooling",
                          "sex" = "Female",
                          "pray" = "Frequency of Prayer",
                          "inc" = "Scale of Incomes",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"))


#' Just as an FYI, this works in order you specify them (i.e. the `justdiv` 
#' variable is displayed first here) and if you don't specify it, it gets 
#' dropped from the summary (i.e. check for typos!).
#' 
#' Finally, it's worth clarifying that `modelsummary()` returns almost all goodness
#' of fit statistic for the model (contingent on the model type) and there are
#' often *lots* of these. You don't need all of them. In the simple linear
#' model, you really just want information about the number of observations at
#' a minimum, and maybe one or both of the R-squares. 
#' 
#' Use the `gof_map` argument to specify what you want. If you don't know what
#' they're called, use `broom::glance()` to see what they're called internally.
broom::glance(M2)

# I want, in order, "nobs", "r.squared", and "adj.r.squared".
modelsummary(list("Bivariate Regression" = M1,
                  "Full Model" = M2),
             stars  = TRUE,
             coef_map = c("justdiv" = "Justifiability of Divorce",
                          "age" = "Age",
                          "educ" = "Age at End of Schooling",
                          "sex" = "Female",
                          "pray" = "Frequency of Prayer",
                          "inc" = "Scale of Incomes",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             gof_map = c("nobs", "adj.r.squared", "r.squared"))

#' Finally, you may want to add a caption that explains that this a regression
#' table. You'll want to call it something better than what I call it here.

modelsummary(list("Bivariate Regression" = M1,
                  "Full Model" = M2),
             stars  = TRUE,
             coef_map = c("justdiv" = "Justifiability of Divorce",
                          "age" = "Age",
                          "educ" = "Age at End of Schooling",
                          "sex" = "Female",
                          "pray" = "Frequency of Prayer",
                          "inc" = "Scale of Incomes",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             gof_map = c("nobs", "adj.r.squared", "r.squared"),
             title = "Hi Mom!")

#' Dope, let's put it in our Word document. In RStudio, click on that viewer of
#' the table. Then: Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V into your Word document. For you
#' Mac users, this should be Cmd instead of Ctrl.
